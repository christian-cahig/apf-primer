**Standard AC optimal power flow**

It is best to think of APF as a heuristic procedure whose outcome is an input to some other procedure in some workflow.
In fact, it was initially conceived as a method for obtaining an initial estimates of the generator injections and the bus voltages
for a *standard AC optimal power flow* task such that the estimates already satisfy the power flow equations.
